The novel feature of this project is the Truist Park page, which displays the current weather at the exact location of the ballpark. I chose this novel feature because I thought it would be a unique addition to the webpage, where users could always be up to date on the exact weather conditions of the Braves home field. I think this feature enhances the project because it shows that the webpage is not just a static page, but rather a dynamic page that can display real-time information. I used the OpenWeather API to implement this feature, which was simple to use and provided the necessary information to display the current weather at Truist Park.
